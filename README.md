# Blog Posting WebApp

📜An interactive blog posting website that can be hosted locally on the system. <br/>
💻Built using HTML, CSS, Flask and SQLAlchemy. <br/>
💼Its main functionalities are adding/editing/deleting blogs, searching for your favourite blog by keyword/title/author and admin edit logs. <hr/>

## 🚀How to implement it?

1. Once you've downloaded the code, create a virtual environment and activate it. (Steps to create a virtual environment can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).)
2. The system requires flask and flask-sqlalchemy. To install them:
  ```
  $ pip install flask
  $ pip install flask_sqlalchemy
  ```
3. To run the server, simply type out ```python app.py``` in your command prompt and open https://127.0.0.0:5000 on your browser. <br/>
